  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now and again us software developers can find ourselves at the start of a new project. Enthusiasm takes over as you begin to consider all the new possibilities that await you. Basking in the envy and jealousy of your fellow developers you know that this is your opportunity to shine; to put things right.  Welcome to Greenfield, the promised land.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the enthusiasm is quickly replaced by disillusionment and panic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_phases_of_a_big_project">1</a> as you realise that no one really knows what to do next. Standing on the precipice of your project as you consider which move to make next you see all of the potential outcome paths, from failure to success, staring back at you. This is your selection. Get it wrong and you could be on the back sliding death spiral project path. Get it right, and you could be on that enlightened path of success.</p>

<p>The intention behind this blog post is to give you a leg up onto that enlightened path. So without further ado, I introduce to my ten topics to discuss and elaborate on during the initial stages of starting a new project. As you read each of the following points in the list below, start to think how you can begin applying them to your project. Understood? Good, lets crack on:</p>

<p>• What are the problems to be solved? First, clearly define &amp; agree a prioritised list of problems that the project is aimed at solving [arch]. This list should at least make you stop and think before you build a solution that doesn’t solve your customers most pressing concerns.</p>

<p>• Why solve these problems?  Hopefully, there should be at least some benefit in solving these problems as these benefits are why this project exists. In general, the business benefit is simply a reverse of the stated problem. Be objective when you ask yourself &#8216;is this project the best way to solve these problems, are there other cheaper or simpler options?&#8217;</p>

<p>• When to solve these problems? Find out your project deadline, and if the project is date-driven or feature-driven. Now is the time to start your countdown clock. Make the number of days remaining on your project highly visible to your team. This will have the desired effect of developing a sense of urgency early in the project between your team members.</p>

<p>• Who will solve these problems? Identify team members, their availability and skill sets. Do those skills match what is required for this project? Thought can also be given to which team structure to adopt. Developers are a funny breed, and motivation is key. Set the correct tone early to get the productivity you require.</p>

<p>• What are the constraints? Constraints are those brick walls that prevent you from taking the solution in a particular direction. It is important that everyone be aware of these and their impact on the day to day decisions that the team makes. Always be willing to test the constraints for validity and see if those walls can be knocked down.</p>

<p>• What are the risks? Identify these upfront, and keep your eyes on them. These torpedoes can sink your project with a single hit. The two main categories to avoid are Classic Mistakes (performed time and time again across a range of projects) and Specific Risks (these are specific to the project you are working on). Attack the risks on your project before they attack you.</p>

<p>• Who are the users? Although a seemingly innocent question, this topic helps you to view the project from multiple different perspectives, which is an important consideration. This facilitates ‘perceived integrity’ allowing you to build a solution that will delight your spectrum of users.</p>

<p>• The Vision Statement: A good vision statement helps reduce friction by aligning your team in the same direction. Consider a story: a Scottish couple decide over breakfast to see a West End show in London the following weekend. During that day the husband books a flight and hotel close to the theatre. In the evening this news is greeted with a mouthful of abuse from an angry wife. Why? Because although they shared the same goal (see West End Show in London) their visions on how to achieve that goal were different. The husband’s vision was to get there quickly, whereas the wife wanted to do it on a budget.  Hold onto this thought when you consider your project when your team don’t share a common vision and the potential impact this can have on all of those day to day decisions to be made.</p>

<p>• The Feasibility Study: Identify and eliminate any potential show stoppers in your risk list via this study. The key is to fail fast, if there is a problem you want to know about it quickly. Include any area of the project that concerns you and devote time to getting comfortable with it. The last thing you want is be 90% complete and to hit a show stopper.</p>

<p>• The Milestones: I see these initially as thought provokers. A simple way to discuss the implementation of your project from a high level, without getting into the details of specific requirements. Use during the early stages of your project to communicate how you intend to decompose the problem space into discrete features. Once agreed, they provide a simple means to track the progress of your project.</p>

<p>So there you have it. That’s my list of recommended topics to discuss and agree on as a team at the beginning of a new project. Now all you have to do is gather the information on these topics with respect to your project, put them into a document, and distribute to the relevant parties. Once complete, you can circulate your document safe in the knowledge that most of the areas that can send a project down the wrong path have been discussed and agreed on. With a solid foundation upon which to build your project, you’re now ready to start on your requirements.</p>

<p>Good Luck.</p>
